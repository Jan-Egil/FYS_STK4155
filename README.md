# FYS-STK4155 Working Folder

 **Authors:** Martin Moen Carstensen, George Stanley Cowie & Jan Egil Ødegård

*This folder contains the following projects:*

**Project 1:** Establishing and applying basic linear regression models in function data and terrain data. Also applying resampling techniques to optimize results.

Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), as well as ridge and lasso shrinkage methods have been used. We've also applied bootstrap and cross validation resampling methods.

**Project 2:** Performing linear regression and classification using neural networks. Comparing neural network methods with other standard methods in linear regression and classification.

Neural networks have been compared to OLS methods for linear regression, both for SGD gradient methods and matrix inversion methods. Neural networks have also been compared to softmax logistic regression for classification problems.

**Project 3:** Trying to solve PDEs and eigenvalue problems using neural networks. This worked out somewhat. Comparing our methods to those of "regular" methods when solving PDEs and finding eigenvectors / eigenvalues of matrices.
